Description: Compute coverage matrices from recount
    https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/ using bwtool
    (https://github.com/CRG-Barcelona/bwtool).
    This makes it easy to explore regions beyond the genes and exons that are
    available in recount. For example, it can be used for
    annotation-agnostic differential expression analyses with the data from the
    recount project as described at
    http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v35/n4/full/nbt.3838.html. This package
    was used for computing expressed regions in the GTEx data as described in 
    biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/03/145656.
