Description: Compute coverage matrices from recount
    https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/ using bwtool.
    This makes it easy to explore regions beyond the genes and exons that are
    available in recount. For example, it can be used for
    annotation-agnostic differential expression analyses with the data from the
    recount project as described at
    http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/08/068478.
